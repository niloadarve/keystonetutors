“She is so kind and gentle almost like its an art form. Honestly though, a hidden gem of a professor that I personally learned a lot from and I hope many others can learn from as well.”

“She is the most kind and caring professor I ever had. Even if you're not very good at your work she will help through it.”

“Shes so kind and her energy is to die for. Literally one of the BEST professors I've encountered in my first year at LaGuardia.”

“Thank you so much for such an amazing class! I learned a lot and feel more confident.”
